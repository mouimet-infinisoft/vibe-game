# Vibe Game

A 3D first-person game experience built with Next.js, React, Three.js, and TypeScript. This project creates an interactive 3D world where players can explore and interact with objects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and enhanced with Three.js for 3D rendering.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features

- 3D world environment
- First-person controls using keyboard
- Point of view camera with shadows and textures
- Interactive objects with advertisement functionality
- Visual effects like fade in/fade out

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
